Build a simple, browser-based quest game using JavaScript (or Python with Flask), HTML, and CSS. The game should include:
A main character the player controls (text or sprite).
A simple storyline with 3–5 quest steps or objectives.
A way to interact with NPCs (non-playable characters) using dialogue boxes.
Inventory system (basic—collect 2–3 items).
A win condition (e.g., completing all quests).
Responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile.
Save game state in local storage (no database needed).
Requirements:
Use only lightweight frameworks (Vanilla JS or minimal React; Flask or FastAPI if using Python).
Game logic and assets should be easy to customize later.
Code must be well-commented and structured for quick deployment (e.g., upload to Netlify or Replit).
Include instructions on how to run the game locally and deploy online.

The name of the game is called App of the Apostles. Its a bible based game about the apostles spreading the gospel to the major cities in their time. Create a game where the apostles (including Paul) are setting up churches from Jerusalem, to Asia minor, all while evading persecution and Roman authorities
